# My Rated Library

## What is it about?

This project exists so I could apply everything I learned through multiple tutorials about Java and Android.

## What does it do?

As a somewhat big reader myself, often trying new books every now and then thanks to Amazon Kindle, I sometimes ask myself: "Did I already read that book?", "Did I like it?", "Should I read another book from that author?"

Thus is born **My Rated Library**, your personal library where you can add books you have read, comment them, and rate them. And every time you rate a book, the author(s) also get a rating, helping you decide about reading another one of their works.

## Is it done?

Not really, since it is for learning. I did everything by hand here, but in the future, I owuld like to use an ORM and something like Butter Knife for the bindings.

And, sadly, its UI is very ugly.
